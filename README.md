### Art Piece 1
![Footfalls](images/footfalls.png "Footfalls")
	The art piece Footfalls created by Golan Levin and Zachary Lieberman is an interactive installation that utilizes both auditory and visual sensing techniques to project images of balls on to a white screen. The balls move according to the movement of bystanders reacting to sound detected by microphones hidden in the floor. I was initially drawn to this piece because of the artists’ choice to create an installation that interacts with individuals on a personal level. Because individuals themselves dictate the images projected on the screen, the art becomes personalized to the body and movements of the individuals rather than the artists. Further, the experience linking individuals to the art through their bodies is one that is powerful. The installation makes me wonder- does art move/inspire people or do people move/inspire art? I think this installation helps prove the answer is both.

### Art Piece 2

	The interactive art installation called Pixi is a digital organism that replicates patterns found in nature. The Pixi installation challenges my very notions of the relationship between nature and technology. I have always juxtaposed the two—thinking that technology was the antithesis of nature. Yet, the Pixi art piece pushes me to think differently, allowing me to imagine a world in which technology is inspired by nature and ultimately compliments nature rather than distracts from it. Pixi’s ability to react and think for itself amazes me. I am interested to learn more about the type of coding that is needed to program such a device so that it can continue functioning on its own.

### Check-in Blog Post
	The process of creating my first project was hard and at times frustrating but ultimately, it was very rewarding I have never coded before and was very intimidated by the prospect of working with technological languages I did not know how to write. However, as the semester has unfolded, I have become increasingly more comfortable leaning into discomfort and embracing my beginner level skillset. I am determined to work hard and create art through this new medium. I appreciate how the class is structured allowing us students to both learn new technical skills and explore using the software, however, I think I am at such a beginning level that I need more guidance when it comes to learning the technical skills. My plan of attack moving forward is to spend more time reading the book Make Getting Started with p5.js and coming to office hours on Tuesdays to ask any questions I may have concerning the software and the week’s assignment. 



### Chance Art Piece 1

![Black Boogie Woogie ](images/larger.jpg "Black Boogie Woogie")

Hanibal Srouji is the artist of this piece, Black Boogie Woogie. Srouji is from Lebanon and is based in Beirut currently. I was drawn to this piece integrating chance because it utilizes both technology and canvas to create a piece that evokes emotion and a sense of inner peace. This piece incorporates chance through its multicolored neon light and the contrast created between the hot, red and the colder,blue is beautiful and stark. Usually, I am drawn to art pieces that make me reflect on the relationship between technology and nature and I think art is a powerful mechanism to explore that relationship.

### Chance Art Piece 2

The artist, Martin Reyna, created this piece titled, Le Bois. Reyna is from Argentina but is based in Paris. I was drawn to this piece because the colors and free movement of the shapes are simple yet dramatic in their course of action. I think her use of chance is reflected in the random shape of the colors on the canvas. While this painting does not utilize technology or algorithms (to my knowledge), I think the concept of chance reflected in the art piece can be applied to a code in which shapes take on courses of their own through a programming code that gives the shapes/colors a life of their own.
